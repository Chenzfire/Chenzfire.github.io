					7/10 Fairly Decent <br>
					The campaign in this game was not the best. It didn't have the most grabbing campaign but what it lacked in campaign it made up for in gameplay. The campaign tried to get you to make a hard decision with the end of the campaign. The gameplay is great, from the gunplay, the steath, to the hunting, the map, and sidemissions. The multiplayer in this game is abysmal.
