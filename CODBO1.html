				<p>
					8/10 Pretty dang good<br>
					The campaign in this game has second best Call of Duty campaigns in all of the games. The Call of Duty that has a better campaign is Call of Duty 2 Big Red One. The campaign starts out with a actual historical event, The Bay of Pigs. Then it continues get even more complex and you meet the some of the best some of the characters and story.<br> The multiplayer in this game was one of the greatest of its time but it hasn't aged the best though the fact that you can change you camouflage was nice to blend in with your environment.<br>
					The zombies was beautiful in this game. It was the best zombies of this age, it was simple nice and simple.
